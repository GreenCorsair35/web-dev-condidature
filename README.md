# web-dev-condidature
This is a repository for a simple web app for my condidature for a web developper job offer.

I used php, js, jquery (datatables), css, materialize css, html.
I used a json file as a local database, it would be easier if I used a sql database, but it was a good refresher for handling json files in php.

This application aims to produce a component to perform the following functions:
- Register a new user with the following information: Username, Email, Password, User Roles (one or more roles can be assigned to the user). Roles must be selected from a drop down list. The available roles are: ROLE_USER, ROLE_SUPERUSER, ROLE_ADMIN, ROLE_NEW.
- Edit user information: Username, Email, Password, Roles.
